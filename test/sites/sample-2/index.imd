## Description of the second Full Meta Jacket sample

This second example of Full Meta Jacket expands upon the first by having

1. a set of posts which are listed above.
2. snippets of code in a ````_partials```` folder
3. nested layouts

### 1. A set of posts

The list of posts to display at the top of this page is taken from the contents of the ````_posts```` directory. The files in any ````_posts```` directory are treated differently from normal files in the following ways:

1. The publish date of a post is taken from the filename and the title is assumed to be the remaining text. e.g. when the file ````2012-06-26-monkeys-in-space.imd```` is processed by Full Meta Jacket, amongst it's set of variables there will be a "date" value of "2012-06-26" and a "title" of "monkeys in space". 

2. Any file inside ````_posts```` that doesn't begin with a date is assumed to be a draft copy and won't be converted into a static file (for example see ````_posts/draft-potential-fourth-post.imd```` which doesn't appear in the final output)

3. The contents of ````_posts```` are "hoisted" up into the parent directory. e.g. a file such as ````./foo/_posts/2012-06-26-blog.imd```` would result in the static file ````./foo/2012-06-26-blog.html````

4. All metadata from the files in ````_posts```` is concatenated into an array and assigned to a variable called ````posts````

### 2. Snippets of code

Looking at the original ````index.imd```` file for this html page you can see that the list of posts at the top were generated with the line:

    { {=: posts | listWith:'post' }}
    
<!-- note  the above line should be:

    {{=: posts | listWith:'post' }}

-->

This takes the ````posts```` list and passes it into the ````listWith```` function along with another variable called ````post```` which represents the partial file that should be used to render each element of ````posts```` . You can see the  ````post```` code in ````_partials/post.html````:

    <li><a href="{{=: 'uri' | printAsVarDecl }}">{{=: 'title' | printAsVarDecl }}</a></li>

### 3. Nested layouts

This index page uses a layout called ````listing-page```` and each post uses a layout called ````post```` . Both files are located in the ````_layouts```` folder, if you view them in a text editor you can see that they each have a "layout" header value of ````default````. This nested structure is a good way of sharing common templating code throughout a site.
